## Background
MuDiBot started as a little bot for my Discord server and began to grow with time.

This bot's goal is to offer many functionalities for both server moderation and administration, but also fun features like custom commands and practical ones like a video player.

Special thanks to [mozico555](https://github.com/mozico555) and Neyo for suggestions, ideas and bug reports.

## Install

Start by cloning this repo and then, fill the `config`. More information will be found inside.

## Usage
Start the bot by running `cargo run`

You can then write `$help` (by default) to display all the available commands.
